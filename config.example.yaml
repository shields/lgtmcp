# Google Gemini API configuration
google:
  # API key for Gemini (required)
  api_key: "your-gemini-api-key-here"

# Model configuration
gemini:
  # Model to use for code review
  # Default: gemini-2.5-pro
  model: "gemini-2.5-pro"

  # Temperature for response generation (0.0-1.0)
  # Lower values (0.0-0.3) are more deterministic and focused
  # Higher values (0.7-1.0) are more creative and varied
  # Default: 0.2 (recommended for highly consistent code reviews)
  temperature: 0.2

  # Retry configuration for handling rate limits and transient errors
  retry:
    # Maximum number of retry attempts (not including the initial attempt)
    # Default: 5
    max_retries: 5

    # Initial backoff duration before first retry
    # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "1s", "500ms", "2m")
    # Default: 1s
    initial_backoff: "1s"

    # Maximum backoff duration between retries
    # Format: Go duration string (e.g., "60s", "5m")
    # Default: 60s
    max_backoff: "60s"

    # Backoff multiplier for exponential backoff
    # Each retry waits: initial_backoff * (multiplier ^ attempt)
    # Default: 1.4
    backoff_multiplier: 1.4

# Security configuration
gitleaks:
  # Custom gitleaks configuration file (optional)
  # Note: Custom configs are not currently supported in the embedded library
